# Initialization, Update, Reset, and Destroy

The `init()` method is the main method of the instance, which initiates the calendar's initialization process.

```js
const calendar = new VanillaCalendar(element, params);
calendar.init();
```

The `update()` method allows you to apply new settings to the calendar and reset it.
This method takes an object with optional arguments to control the reset, by default retaining the user-selected date, month, and year after the update.

All arguments, default `false`:

```ts
{
  year: boolean;
  month: boolean;
  dates: boolean | 'only-first';
  holidays: boolean;
  time: boolean;
}
```

- `true` - will be reset to the parameters specified in `settings`;
- `false` - will not perform a reset, will leave the parameters selected by the user;
- `'only-first'` - resets all selected dates, leaving the earliest one. If the date picker type is specified as `'multiple-ranged'`, a `'mousemove'` and `'keydown'` handler is added for the hover.

Example of usage:

```js
calendar.settings.lang = 'de-AT';
calendar.settings.iso8601 = false;

calendar.update({
	dates: true,
});
```

Additionally, if you want to completely remove the calendar instance, you can use the `destroy()` method.

Example of usage:

```js
calendar.destroy();
```
